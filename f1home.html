      <p style="text-align: justify; width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">Formula One, or F1, is the top class of international
        racing for open-wheel single-seater cars, sanctioned by
        the FIA. Since its debut in 1950, the FIA Formula One World Championship has been a premier
        racing series. The term "formula" refers to the rules all cars must follow, and a season consists of multiple
        races, known as Grands Prix, held on purpose-built circuits or closed public roads around the world...</p>

          Formula One began in 1946, with its first World Championship in 1950 at Silverstone, where Giuseppe
          Farina won over Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio dominated early on with five titles until Michael Schumacher
          surpassed him in 2003. The Constructors' Championship started in 1958, and while Stirling Moss is a legendary
          driver, he never won a
          title. The sport evolved with innovations from teams like Alfa Romeo and Ferrari until non-championship events
          ended in 1983
          due to rising costs.</p>

          Bugatti's mid-engined cars transformed Formula One, with Jack Brabham proving their superiority by 1961. In
          1962, Lotus introduced an aluminum monocoque chassis. Sponsorship entered the sport in 1968 with Team Gunston,
          followed by Lotus. That year also saw a shift toward aerodynamics with aerofoils, leading to Lotus’s
          ground-effect designs in the late 1970s, which significantly increased downforce and required stiff
          suspensions
          reliant on tires for cushioning.
