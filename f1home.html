        racing for open-wheel single-seater cars, sanctioned by

        racing series. The term "formula" refers to the rules all cars must follow, and a season consists of multiple

          Formula One began in 1946, with its first World Championship in 1950 at Silverstone, where Giuseppe
          Farina won over Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio dominated early on with five titles until Michael Schumacher
          surpassed him in 2003. The Constructors' Championship started in 1958, and while Stirling Moss is a legendary
          driver, he never won a
          title. The sport evolved with innovations from teams like Alfa Romeo and Ferrari until non-championship events
          ended in 1983
          due to rising costs.</p>
